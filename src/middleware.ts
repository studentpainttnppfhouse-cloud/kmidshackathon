/**
 * Transport and content-security policy, applied to every request.
 *
 * Three jobs:
 *
 *   1. Refuse plain HTTP. Render terminates TLS at its edge and forwards
 *      `x-forwarded-proto`, so the app is the only place that can tell whether
 *      the browser's leg of the connection was encrypted. A session cookie on
 *      an http:// request is a session cookie somebody on the school Wi-Fi can
 *      read, so it is redirected before the app ever sees it, and HSTS then
 *      makes the browser stop trying.
 *
 *   2. Ship a real Content-Security-Policy. Everything else in this codebase
 *      escapes output correctly today; CSP is what keeps a future mistake from
 *      becoming an account takeover. The nonce is generated per request and
 *      Next.js picks it up automatically for its own bundles.
 *
 *   3. Slide the session cookie's expiry forward. A signed-in person must be
 *      able to stay signed in for months without ever seeing the login page,
 *      and the middleware is the only place on a normal page request where a
 *      cookie may legally be written — Next rejects a write from a Server
 *      Component, which is where the renewal used to live.

/**
 * Stored attachments are bytes somebody uploaded, served from the origin that
 * holds everybody's session cookie.
 *
 * The route already refuses to serve anything outside a small allowlist as
 * itself — everything else comes back as `application/octet-stream` with a
 * download disposition — but the policy below is the belt to that pair of
 * braces: nothing loads, nothing runs, and the sandbox denies the response an
 * origin of its own even if a browser one day decides to render it anyway.
 *
 * It lives here rather than only in the route because the middleware's header
 * is the one that survives: `NextResponse.next()` merges over whatever the
 * handler set, so a policy written only in the route would be quietly replaced
 * by the ordinary page policy.
