 * A Server Action already carries the session cookie, already has its Origin
 * checked by the framework, and already runs the same `requireViewer()` every
 * other write in this codebase runs — so there is no new authentication path
 * and no new CSRF surface. `next.config.ts` raises the body limit to match
 * MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES; anything over it never reaches this function.
 *
 * Files are written the moment they are chosen, not when the surrounding form
 * is submitted. That is the difference between "I attached it" and "I attached
 * it and then the browser died before I pressed save", and on a phone on school
 * Wi-Fi the second one happens.
