/**
 * The portal, page by page, and what each tier may do with each one.
 *
 * `policy.ts` answers "may this person change this record?". This file answers
 * the question in front of it: "may this person be on this page at all?" The
 * two are deliberately separate. Record rules are the shape of the work — a
 * head approves inside their own team, a member edits their own task — and
 * those do not change from one season to the next. Page rules are the owner's
 * to set, because which teams get to see the audit log or the accounts screen
 * is an organisational decision, not an engineering one.
 *
 * Three properties hold, and everything below exists to keep them true:
 *
 *   1. This grid only ever *narrows*. A tier set to EDIT here still only does
 *      what its role allows, so handing members EDIT on Announcements does not
 *      make them broadcasters. That is why a mistake in the grid is a page
 *      somebody cannot reach, never a permission somebody should not have.
 *
 *   2. The defaults are today's behaviour, exactly. An untouched portal after
 *      this change behaves like the portal before it, so the feature is opt-in
 *      one cell at a time rather than a migration everybody has to survive.
 *
 *   3. Some cells cannot be set at all. The owner may not hide the dashboard
 *      from themselves, and no grid entry can put a member in the accounts
 *      screen. Those are `locked` and `floor` below, and they are enforced in
 *      `page-access.ts` rather than in the form, because a disabled radio is
 *      not access control.
