/**

 * bytes. That decision was right about Render's disk — it is wiped on every
 * deploy, so an uploads directory is a directory of files that disappear next
 * Tuesday — and wrong about the conclusion it drew, because the disk was never
 * the only place to put a file. TiDB survives every redeploy the disk does not.
 *
 * So bytes live in `attachment_chunks`, and:
 *
 *   - a file attached from a phone at the back of a classroom is still there
 *     after the next deploy, on every other device that signs in;
 *   - there is one backup story, not two: the JSON export and the database
 *     dump already cover it;
 *   - "who can read this file" is the same question as "who can read the task
 *     it hangs off", answered by the same policy module.
 *
 * The old link path has not gone anywhere. Over the size limit, an attachment
 * keeps its name and points at Drive, which is the honest answer for a 400 MB
 * export video: the portal was never going to be the right home for that.
